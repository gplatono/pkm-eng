# Concept drift

**Concept drift** is a phenomenon is statistical learning and data science when the statistical properties of the target variable (the *concept*) change over time. This poses significant challenge since any model trained on the previous data will either need to be retrained when concept drift occurs, or it needs to incorporate some mechanism to take the change into account. A related problem is the concept drift detection, i.e., discovering the very fact that the concept drift is occuring. This can be achieved, e.g., by tracking the model performance over time and detecting persisting drops in the quality of predictions.
