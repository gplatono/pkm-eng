# Provenance

*Provenance* (source/place of origin) is a validated history of creation and ownership of an information artifact, such as a library, a code package, a file, etc. It is an important concept in the area of [supply chain security](supply%20chain%20security.md), that is used to trace the history of artifact changes and who contributed to said changes in order to establish the artifact's authenticity and levels of trust.
