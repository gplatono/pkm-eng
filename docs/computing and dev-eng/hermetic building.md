# Hermetic building

Hermetic building (hermetic builds) refer to building software artifacts in a way that is self-contained and guarantees reproducibility: given the same input source and build configuration, the output artifacts will always be identical. This is achieved by removing dependencies on external (unmanaged) dependencies.
